Audio Control Panel - RNNoise Denoising

This is a browser extension designed to capture and process audio from any active tab in real-time. Using the powerful RNNoise (WebAssembly) engine, it effectively suppresses background noise from sources like videos, live streams, or online meetings, isolating human voices for a clearer listening experience.

The extension features a simple control panel that visualizes both the original and the denoised audio waveforms, allowing you to see the effect of the noise reduction instantly.

Key Features:

Real-time Noise Suppression: Denoise audio from any browser tab on the fly.

High-Quality Engine: Powered by RNNoise (.wasm) for effective, low-latency voice enhancement.

Visual Feedback: Compares the original and processed audio waveforms in a side-by-side view.

Stereo-to-Mono Processing: Automatically converts stereo audio sources into mono for compatibility with the noise suppression model.
